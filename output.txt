0) Given:
	x ~ y
	y ~ (* 2 z)
1) Applying even-reverse:
	even ~ y
2) Applying subst:
	(* 2 z) ~ x
3) Applying even-reverse:
	even ~ x
================================

Proof 6:
Given x = y and y is even, prove x is even.
0) Given:
	x ~ y
	y ~ even
1) Applying subst:
	x ~ even
================================

Proof 7:
Given x = (+ (* 2 a) (* 2 b)) for some a and b, prove x is even.
0) Given:
	x ~ (+ (* 2 a) (* 2 b))
1) Applying factor:
	(* 2 (+ a b)) ~ x
2) Applying even-reverse:
	even ~ x
