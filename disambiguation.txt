What are statements? A statement is a set of tuples...

	{identifiers} ≃ ℕ
	{odd, unknown, even} ≃ {-1, 0, 1}
	expr := c 				(constant)
		  | x 				(identifier)
		  | (+ expr expr)
		  | (* expr expr)

	statements are subsets of this set:

		X = ℕ × {-1, 0, 1} × {expr}

	So a statement A ⊆ X.
	A = {(a₁, b₁, c₁), (a₂, b₂, c₂), ...}
	where aᵢ∈ ℕ, bⱼ∈ {-1, 0, 1}, and cₖ∈ {expr} ∀ i,j,k ∈ ℕ

How are proofs constructed?

	Consider A ⊆ X and B ⊆ X. A proof of B using A is a function 

		f:P(X) → P(X) such that f(A) = B. (P(X) is the power set of X)

	This reminds me of the BHK interpretation, where a proof of A → B is a function that takes a proof of A and returns a proof of B.

	What I've done so far is similar in that I assume A, and search for a function that transforms a proof of A into a proof of B.
